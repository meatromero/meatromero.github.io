                  <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>

                  <p>
                    My name is LUKA, but I also go by MEATGRIND. 26yo; she/they
                    pronouns please! It was my childhood dream to set up a
                    little website all for myself, so here u go 10 year old me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I consider myself a generalist as an artist: as in, I do a
                    little bit of everything and am willing to try most creative
                    pursuits at least once <s>(then abandon them a month or two later lmao)</s>. Some
                    things I've tried with varying degrees of success and
                    longevity are character illustration (furry/humanoid),
                    vtuber model creation and rigging, low poly 3d modeling,
                    pixel art, game development, graphic design,
                    sculpting...there'll probably be more LMAO
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Anyway, this website was born partly out of a frustration
                    with the modern internet that's nowhere near as cool as the
                    internet I grew up with (the entire reason I wanted to learn
                    how to code to begin with) (• ᴖ •｡) and partly because I
                    just think having a little digital enclosure for myself is
                    banger as hell.
                  </p>
